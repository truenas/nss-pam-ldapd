	  want to check to see if it is a reasonable name (e.g. not a DN)

	  instead of write() so we don't have to muck with signal handlers

2008-05-16  arthur

	* [r739] nslcd/log.c, nslcd/log.h, nslcd/nslcd.c: include a random
	  string in every log message to be able to group log messages for
	  a single request
	* [r738] common/tio.c, nslcd/myldap.c: add sanity checks to sleep
	  calls to never sleep too long (problems could occur when the

	* [r737] nss/group.c: remove comment about limitation that has now
	  been removed
	* [r736] nss/common.c: grow the read buffer maximum size to 2Mbyte

	* [r733] nslcd/myldap.c: close the connection and retry the search

	* [r732] nslcd/myldap.c: split retry mechanism of myldap_search()
	  into a new do_retry_search() function
	* [r731] nslcd/myldap.c: allocate the search memory region in

	  return an LDAP status code
	* [r730] nslcd/myldap.c: also allow closing of searches that no
	  longer have a valid connection and integrate myldap_search_free()
	  into myldap_search_close()

2008-05-04  arthur

	* [r721] debian/libnss-ldapd.nslcd.init: add soft dependency on
	  slapd, simplify network and file system dependencies and add
	  reverse dependencies on some common daemons that may want to do
	  NSS lookups

2008-05-02  arthur

	* [r720] nss/netgroup.c, nss/prototypes.h: remove checking for
	  first entry and always return NSS_STATUS_RETURN when no more data
	  is available in the netgroup (this has the side effect of not
	  returning NSS_STATUS_NOTFOUND for non-existing netgroups but
	  seems to be what other NSS modules do) to properly handle empty
	  netgroups
	* [r719] tests, tests/Makefile.am, tests/test_nslcd_group.c: add
	  file for testing nslcd/group.c
	* [r718] tests/Makefile.am: don't even compile the test programs on
	  make check
	* [r717] tests/Makefile.am: don't compile test code on every build
	  and fix LDADD lists to include correct objects
	* [r716] nslcd/cfg.c, nslcd/cfg.h, nslcd/myldap.c: only support
	  tls-related options if LDAP library supports TLS, only add rebind
	  code if ldap_set_rebind_proc() is found and only set
	  LDAP_X_OPT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT if that option is supported

2008-05-01  arthur

	* [r715] nslcd/myldap.c: support ranged attribute values
	* [r714] nss/common.h: fix comment of return value of

	* [r713] tests/test_myldap.c: fix a warning
	* [r712] tests/test_myldap.c: ensure that filter_get_var() and

	  with attribute mapping and filter settings and use base from
	  config file

2008-04-29  arthur

	* [r711] man/nss-ldapd.conf.5.xml: make language about pagesize
	  option a little clearer

	  LDAP_SERVER_DOWN (besides LDAP_UNAVAILABLE)
	* [r708] man/nss-ldapd.conf.5.xml, nss/common.c: increase time out
	  values because now nslcd will error out more quickly if the LDAP
	  server is known to be unavailable
	* [r707] nslcd/nslcd.c: spelling fix in comment
	* [r706] man/nss-ldapd.conf.5.xml: some spelling fixes and a

	* [r704] nslcd/passwd.c: make log message a little more descriptive
	* [r703] configure.ac: fix quote in comment
	* [r702] nslcd/myldap.c: ensure that the connection to the LDAP
	  server is closed whenever any of the ldap_*() functions return
	  LDAP_UNAVAILABLE

2008-04-25  arthur

	* [r701] man/nss-ldapd.conf.5.xml, nslcd/cfg.c, nslcd/cfg.h,
	  nslcd/myldap.c, tests/nss-ldapd-test.conf, tests/test_cfg.c,
	  tests/test_myldap.c: implement new timing mechanism for retries
	  to quickly fail lookups to LDAP server that have been failing for
	  some time, removing the reconnect_tries option and giving
	  reconnect_sleeptime and reconnect_maxsleeptime options a new
	  meaning
	* [r700] tests/test_myldap.c: include missing include
	* [r699] tests/test_myldap.c: ignore SIGPIPE in myldap tests
	* [r698] tests/test_myldap.c: fix assert to be test instead of
	  assignment
	* [r697] tests/test_myldap.c, tests/test_myldap.sh: have the binary
	  look up the file name and only use the shell script wrapper to
	  determine if LDAP server is available
	* [r696] compat/ether.h: fix typos in references to
	  HAVE_ETHER_NTOA_R and HAVE_ETHER_ATON_R macros

2008-04-23  arthur

	* [r695] tests/test_nsscmds.sh: fix order of members in group in
	  tests because of new hashing dict (maybe we should fix the script
	  instead to always sort members properly)
	* [r694] common/dict.c: fix problem where first item in the
	  hashtable could be returned twice while looping
	* [r693] tests/test_dict.c: add test for problem with duplicate
	  entries being returned while looping over results
	* [r692] nslcd/passwd.c: don't issue warning when
	  myldap_get_entry() returns NULL and LDAP_SUCCESS

2008-04-21  arthur

	* [r691] common/dict.c: allocate room for key string just after
	  entry to save on calls to malloc() and make it simpler

2008-04-20  arthur

	* [r690] nslcd/group.c, nslcd/passwd.c: fix tests for valid user
	  and group names
	* [r689] nslcd/common.h, nslcd/group.c, nslcd/passwd.c: add checks
	  for valid user and group names in incoming requests and for data
	  returned from LDAP
	* [r688] nslcd/group.c: only support uniqueMember containing DN
	  values
	* [r687] nslcd/group.c: fix warning message to not refer to alias

	  the group members

	  tests/Makefile.am, tests/test_set.c: implement a set that uses
	  the dict module as back-end
	* [r680] common/dict.c: implement new dict module that uses a
	  hashtable which is around 40 times faster for large (around 2000)
	  entries but with around 40% more memory used
	* [r679] tests/Makefile.am, tests/test_dict.c, tests/usernames.txt:
	  some new tests for the dictionary module
	* [r678] nslcd/passwd.c: add test for emtpy DN

2008-04-18  arthur

	* [r677] nslcd/myldap.c: instead of using the dict module to build
	  a cache just store the values in an fixed-sized array because no
	  more than 9 attributes are currently retrieved from an entry and
	  we never retrieve the same value more than once (so the cache is
	  useless)

2008-04-17  arthur

	* [r676] common/dict.h: add note about freed values
	* [r675] common/dict.c, common/dict.h, nslcd/myldap.c,

	  couldn't do a DN->uid lookup

	  man/nslcd.8.xml, man/nss-ldapd.conf.5.xml: get files ready for
	  0.6.1 release
	* [r669] config.guess, config.sub: include updated files

	  rootbind{dn,pw} options from packaging because the options are
	  not likely to be implemented in the future

	  member->group searches by also searching for DN in uniqueMember
	  attribute
	* [r662] nslcd/log.c: make log line a little bigger to properly log
	  more search filters
	* [r661] nslcd/nslcd.c: only return shadow entries to root users
	* [r660] nss/group.c: correctly implement buffer handling in
	  _nss_ldap_initgroups_dyn() to grow buffer when needed, check
	  limits and handle extra group parameter (had a closer look at
	  nis-initgroups.c)
	* [r659] tests/test_nsscmds.sh: no problem to shout a little with
	  failed tests
	* [r658] nss/group.c: properly check the limit (as seen in

	  nslcd/cfg.h, nslcd/myldap.c, nss-ldapd.conf: remove code that
	  handles special cases when calling as root (removing rootbinddn,
	  rootbindpw, rootuse_sasl and rootsasl_authid options)
	* [r652] nslcd/myldap.c: revert r628 (using ldap_str2dn() instead
	  of ldap_explode_r?dn()) for now to make this compile on older
	  versions of OpenLDAP

	  the pagesize option

2008-04-02  arthur

	  <pere@hungry.com> for the patch)

2008-03-16  arthur

	* [r642] debian/libnss-ldapd.config, debian/libnss-ldapd.postinst:
	  comment out all rootbind{dn,pw} code as to not copy those
	  directives because they are unsupported
	* [r641] debian/libnss-ldapd.config: use tail instead of head to
	  avoid conflicts becase nss_ldap seems to pick up the last option
	  in the file
	* [r640] debian/libnss-ldapd.config: handle the case where an
	  option is defined multiple times

2008-03-06  arthur

	  <rhafer@suse.de>
	* [r633] nslcd/myldap.c: pass URI to do_bind() to make it work with

	* [r629] common/tio.c: always allocate the read and write buffers
	  and make the struct tio_buffer inline in struct tio_fileinfo

2008-02-10  arthur

	  ldap_explode_rdn() with a call to ldap_str2dn() resulting in much

	* [r627] nslcd/cfg.c: only support "dns" and "domain" values on
	  platforms with the necessary functions available
	* [r626] nslcd/ether.c: don't define struct ether_addr here, it was
	  moved to compat/ether.h

	  configure.ac, nslcd/ether.c: provide replacements for
	  ether_aton_r() and ether_ntoa_r() for platforms that don't have
	  them
	* [r623] configure.ac, nslcd/nslcd.c: only call
	  __nss_configure_lookup() if it is available, if it isn't the
	  platform is out of luck

	  new LDAP lookups
	* [r615] nslcd/attmap.c, nslcd/attmap.h, nslcd/group.c: support the

	  translated with dn2uid() from passwd.c)
	* [r614] debian/libnss-ldapd.postinst, debian/libnss-ldapd.postrm,
	  debian/rules: don't use dh_makeshlibs any more because we don't
	  need the shlibs file; call ldconfig from maintainer scripts
	  ourselves
	* [r613] debian/rules: install the NSS library under /lib instead
	  of /usr/lib to make it easyer to unmount /usr if it's on a
	  separate filesystem

	  not used

	  isn't used
	* [r610] nslcd/common.h, nslcd/passwd.c: implement a dn2uid()

	  or doing an LDAP lookup if neede)
	* [r609] nslcd/myldap.c, nslcd/myldap.h: implement
	  myldap_cpy_rdn_value() function to copy rdn value into a buffer
	  (functionality like myldap_get_rdn_value())

	  ldap_parse_page_control()
	* [r607] nslcd/myldap.c: fix copy-pasto

	  with scope base and ignore errors of ldap_create_page_control()
	* [r605] nslcd/myldap.c: reset LDAP error flag if ldap_get_values()
	  returned an error because some LDAP functions don't do this
	  correctly

2008-02-01  arthur

	* [r604] nslcd/myldap.c: have proper checks and logs of all ldap
	  operations
	* [r603] tests/test_group.c: enable _nss_ldap_initgroups_dyn() test
	  because it's working now
	* [r602] nslcd-common.h: fix buffer size debug message
	* [r601] nss/common.h, nss/hosts.c, nss/netgroup.c, nss/networks.c:

	  get*ent() (this apparently is needed by coreutils' id and groups
	  commands)

	* [r599] tests/test_nsscmds.sh: test for hugegroup
	* [r598] tests/test_nsscmds.sh: the groups command no longer lists
	  the username
	* [r597] nss/common.c, nss/common.h, nss/group.c, nss/hosts.c,
	  nss/netgroup.c, nss/networks.c: remove the nslcd2nss() function
	  because it's not needed with the current protocol
	* [r596] nss/common.h: fail with a permanent error if resetting the
	  stream failed to prevent indefinite retries

2008-01-31  arthur

	* [r595] nslcd/myldap.c: defined LDAP_DEPRECATED to also have
	  definitions for deprecated functions

	  if statements consistent
	* [r587] configure.ac: move finding of replacement functions to a

	  extensions from system header files and remove duplicate check
	  for ldap_set_rebind_proc()
	* [r585] configure.ac: test to see if the compiler supports certain
	  -W flags before using them

2008-01-30  arthur

	* [r584] nslcd/ether.c: include stdint.h
	* [r583] nslcd.h, nslcd/ether.c, nss/ethers.c: use uint8_t instead
	  of u_int8_t because the former seems to be available on more
	  platforms
	* [r582] INSTALL, depcomp, install-sh: update some files from
	  recent automake
	* [r581] compat/Makefile.am, compat/daemon.c, compat/daemon.h,
	  compat/getopt_long.c, compat/getopt_long.h, configure.ac: provide
	  replacement functions for daemon() and getopt_long() when they

	  integrate some compatibility code into myldap.c, the only place
	  it's used
	* [r573] nslcd/myldap.c: work around some LDAP libraries not having
	  all options
	* [r572] configure.ac, nslcd/myldap.h: on some systems lber.h needs
	  to be included before ldap.h
	* [r571] common/tio.c, nslcd-common.h, nslcd/nslcd.c, nss/common.c,
	  tests/test_tio.c: when including stdint.h check if we actually
	  have it
	* [r570] nslcd/pagectrl.c, nslcd/pagectrl.h: correct #endif comment

2008-01-26  arthur

	* [r559] nslcd/nslcd.c: close connections in worker threads at
	  program termination
	* [r558] nslcd/nslcd.c: make code a little more compact, don't

	  /etc/group

	  compat is used (except with netgroups)
	* [r555] nslcd/passwd.c, nss/prototypes.h: update copyright year
	* [r554] tests/test_nsscmds.sh: get the number of groups and
	  services from files in /etc for comparison
	* [r553] nslcd/passwd.c: do not warn about missing loginShell
	  attribute because it is not mandatory
	* [r552] nss/group.c: increment value that is pointed to, not the
	  pointer (fixes segfault)

2008-01-02  arthur

	* [r551] nslcd/common.h: immediatly bail out if write entity
	  function failed (prevents numerous "error writing to client"

	  to support retries of the getent() functions when
	  NSS_STATUS_TRYAGAIN would be returned
	* [r547] common/tio.c, common/tio.h, tests/test_tio.c: add limited
	  implementation of tio_mark() and tio_reset() functions to do
