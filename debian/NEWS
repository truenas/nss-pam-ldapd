nss-pam-ldapd (0.7.0) unstable; urgency=low

    The package has been split into libnss-ldapd which contains the the NSS
    module, libpam-ldapd which contains the PAM module and nslcd which
    includes the daemon that performs the LDAP operations.

    The configuration file has been changed to /etc/nslcd.conf to reflect this
    new organisation of packages (upgrades should create this file based on
    any existing /etc/nss-ldapd.conf file).
